# Project Proposal

## 1. Project Overview

​	On the SUSTech campus, there is a wide variety of channels for releasing information about events, covering a wide range of methods such as emails, public numbers, QQ groups, and so on. However, this diversity also brings some inconvenience to students and faculty. For example, students who want to participate in an event need to search for the availability of relevant information on various channels, which causes a certain degree of inconvenience. In addition, organizers who hold events also need to release information about the event on different channels, while there may be many different forms of registration, such as using questionnaire stars, WeChat groups, or filling out Tencent documents. 

​	To address these issues and make life easier for SUSTech students and faculty, we plan to develop a comprehensive campus event service website. The site will allow SUSTech students and faculty to *browse information about various performances (e.g., musical concerts), lectures, competitions and other events on campus*, and provide functions such as *booking, purchasing tickets and writing reviews*.
