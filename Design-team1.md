### 1. Architectural Design 

**Overview:**

The software architecture of our team project is designed around a client-server model, which serves as the foundation for the system's structure and functionality. This architecture was chosen for its ability to effectively separate the frontend and backend components, enabling a clear distinction between the presentation layer that interacts with users (frontend) and the data management layer responsible for processing and storing information (backend).

**Description:**

The frontend components of our system are primarily focused on user interaction and interface design. These components include the User Interface (UI) elements that users interact with, such as event listings, user profiles, and activity sharing features. The frontend is responsible for presenting information in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner, ensuring a seamless user experience.

On the other hand, the backend components handle data storage, processing user requests, and ensuring the security of the system. This includes server-side logic for managing user authentication, event data, and interactions between users. The backend components play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and security of the system's data.

 The interaction between the frontend and backend components is facilitated through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs enable seamless communication and data exchange between the frontend and backend systems, allowing for efficient transfer of information and actions. This ensures that the system operates smoothly and that data is transmitted securely between different components.

The client-server architecture was selected to ensure scalability and maintainability of the system. By separating the presentation layer from the data processing layer, the system can be easily scaled to accommodate a growing user base. Additionally, this architecture allows for modular design, making it easier to update and maintain different components of the system as needed.

By adopting this client-server architecture, our team aims to deliver a robust and user-friendly campus event service website that caters to the needs of SUSTech students and faculty members. The platform is designed to provide easy event browsing, seamless participation in activities, and social interaction among users. The architecture is intended to support the platform's growth and evolution, ensuring that it remains efficient, secure, and user-centric.

The main interface of the application features an activity list, which includes components displaying key information and images of all activities. Additionally, there are buttons for "My Moment" and "My Event", a search bar, filters, a calendar, and a section for newly added comments.
